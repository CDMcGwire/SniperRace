# Sniper Race

A standalone recreation of the "Death Race" game mode featured in the XBLA classic(for some of us)
[_“Hidden in Plain Sight”_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T9pd0T24Ts), using UE4 as a base and
with online multiplayer support.

_Currently shelved to refocus efforts on an existing project._
